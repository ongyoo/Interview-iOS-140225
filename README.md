# Project: Find the 2nd Largest Even Number 
## Description:
Create an app where the user enters a list of numbers in a UITextField (separated by commas). The app will then find the second largest even number in the list.

Details:

UI: Use a UITextField to accept input from the user (numbers separated by commas), a UIButton to allow the user to submit the input, and a UILabel to display the result. \
Logic: The app will identify even numbers from the list, then find the second largest even number without using the sort() method for added challenge. 

## Example Input:
User Input: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 13, 18, 19  \
Result: The second largest even number is 10. This is a simple yet effective problem that tests the ability to handle basic string input, filtering data (for even numbers), and finding the second largest value from a subset of numbers.
